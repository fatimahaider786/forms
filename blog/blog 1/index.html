        <p> By <b> Business Desk </b> |Published Sep 18, 2025 | 6:45 pm </p>

        <p>Pakistan Software Export Board (PSEB), under the Ministry of Information Technology and Telecommunication, has completed Pakistanâ€™s largest Women Software Technology Park (WSTP) at the Womenâ€™s University in Bagh, Azad Jammu and Kashmir.</p>


        
        <p>Spanning 5,000 square feet, the facility is exclusively designed for women in the technology sector, offering a secure and modern workspace.</p>


        <p>An investment of 31 million rupees has been made to bring this project to life, making it the first-ever women-only technology park in the country. Developed in collaboration with the Special Communications Organization (SCO-AJK) and the Womenâ€™s University of AJK, the park provides ICT-enabled office space of approximately 5,000 square feet</p>

        <p>The facility is now ready to welcome IT and IT-enabled Services (ITeS) companies. To mark its soft launch, PSEB will organize an Open House Session on September 23, 2025, at the Women University Bagh, inviting interested companies and stakeholders to explore the opportunities it offers. </p>

        <p>The initiative represents a milestone in PSEBâ€™s broader agenda to empower women, foster entrepreneurship, and promote innovation in the IT sector. By creating Pakistanâ€™s first women-only technology park, the project aims to ensure equal opportunities for women professionals and entrepreneurs, enabling them to overcome social and infrastructural barriers to participate in the technology industry</p>

<p>According to PSEB, the establishment of the WSTP also aligns with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly those focused on gender equality and inclusive economic growth. By bridging the gender gap and cultivating a new stream of skilled professionals, the park is expected to contribute significantly to innovation-driven development and job creation in the region.</p>


<p>The selection of Bagh, AJK, as the site for the WSTP carries strategic importance. The regionâ€™s remote location has historically limited access to resources and advanced technology, forcing many aspiring professionals to move to larger cities for career opportunities. With the completion of this park, women in Bagh will now have access to world-class facilities at their doorstep, reducing barriers and fostering local economic growth.</p>

<p>PSEB is inviting IT companies seeking affordable, secure, and strategically located office space in Bagh to attend the Open House Session and submit their Expressions of Interest (EOIs). The park is part of PSEBâ€™s expanding nationwide network of Software Technology Parks, where over 1.9 million square feet of IT-enabled office space has already been provisioned for more than 350 firms.
